# Pokemon_Game
A Pokemon Game I designed as a homework for the Object Oriented Programming  Course.
In pokemon file, attributes and methods of the pokemon class is defined. There is inheritance relationship between pokemon and electric and psychic pokemon classes, therefore, there are only small additions in these files.
In the arena.cpp file, the main task of simulating a pokemon battle is done, along with other arena functions which are helpful for the battle simulation.
A UML class diagram for the project is provided, which shows the relationships between the classes.
